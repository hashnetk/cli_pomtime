# cli_pompom_alpha
_Current version is for **Windows users with Python installed** and may not work as expected on other systems._ 

**_cli_pompom_alpha_** is a command-line Python-based Pomodoro timer that helps you stay productive. This tool is a work-in-progress, and some features are limited based on the current version. 

#### *Alpha Features:*
- Customizable Timers: Set your work, short break, and long breaks (in minutes).
- Cycle System: Configure how many work sessions you want before a long break.
- Live Countdown: See time remaining in MM:SS format, updating every second.
- Basic Input Validation: Prevents crashes from non-numeric inputs.
- Encouraging Finish Message: Tells you when your Pomodoro session is complete.
 
###  🍰 Installation - (Easy Install)
  1. Install [Python 3.13.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to your system. 
  2. Download the Python file [cli_pomopom_alpha.py](https://github.com/hashnetk/cli_pomtime/blob/main/pom/cli_pompom_alpha.py) *(Downlaod Raw File)* 📥
  3. Double-Click `cli_pompom_alpha.py` and _*Pompom*_ is ready! 
  4. *Make sure *`.py`* files are set to open with Python — (usually they are if Python was installed properly.*)

### 💀 (Bug-Fix Install)
   1. Open **Command Prompt** (Press **Windows key + R**, then type "cmd" and hit Enter).
   3. Check the folder where you saved **_cli_pomopom_alpha.py_** file.
   4. Type in terminal *`cd C:\Users\bettywap124\Desktop\pom`*
   5. Lastly *`python cli_pompom_alpha.py`* and hit Enter!

&nbsp;

> 🐞 **Bug Found**: Terminal closes too fast after the timer ends — future versions will fix this! For now, you can open the file manually in **Command Prompt or PowerShell** to bypass this.
